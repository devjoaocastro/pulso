        Perform a deep weekly analysis of business performance.

        **Business Context**: {{task}}

        Analyze (last 7 days vs previous 7 days):

        1. **Revenue Analysis**
           - Total revenue, average order value, conversion rate
           - Revenue by product/service
           - Revenue by source (organic, ads, referral, social)
           - Week-over-week growth rate

        2. **Marketing Performance**
           - Posts published: engagement rate per post
           - Best performing content (type, time, topic)
           - Worst performing content (why?)
           - Hashtag effectiveness
           - Follower growth

        3. **Sales Pipeline**
           - Leads generated (by source)
           - Conversion rate (lead → customer)
           - Average deal cycle time
           - Lost deals analysis (why did they not convert?)

        4. **Customer Insights**
           - Support tickets by category
           - Customer satisfaction indicators
           - Common questions/complaints
           - Repeat purchase rate

        5. **Cost Analysis**
           - Agent costs (LLM tokens + tools)
           - Ad spend (if any)
           - Cost per lead, cost per acquisition
           - ROI by channel

        Output structured data with specific numbers, percentages, and comparisons.

        Based on the weekly analytics, generate specific optimization strategies.

        **Business Context**: {{task}}

        For each area, propose concrete changes:

        1. **Content Optimization**
           - What content type should we do MORE of? (based on engagement data)
           - What should we STOP doing? (low engagement)
           - New content ideas based on trends
           - A/B test proposals (test what against what)

        2. **Pricing Optimization**
           - Should prices change? (based on conversion data)
           - Bundle/upsell opportunities
           - Discount strategy for slow periods

        3. **Channel Optimization**
           - Which channels have best ROI?
           - Should we add/remove any channels?
           - Posting time optimization (when does the audience engage most?)

        4. **Sales Process**
           - Response time improvements
           - Script improvements (based on objections)
           - Follow-up sequence tuning

        5. **Growth Experiments**
           - 3 experiments to run next week
           - Each with: hypothesis, metric, expected impact, effort

        Be specific and data-driven. No vague suggestions.
        Each recommendation should have an expected impact estimate.
