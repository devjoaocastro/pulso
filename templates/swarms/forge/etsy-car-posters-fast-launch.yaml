        2) JDM wall art bundles
        3) Custom blueprint posters (buyer submits car model)
        4) Motorsport retro posters (rally/F1/classic)

        Output:
        - Demand score (0-100) per segment
        - Competition density (low/medium/high)
        - Typical price range
        - 3 winning angles with best speed-to-first-sale
        - Final recommendation: which 1 segment to launch first

        2) Exact prices in EUR for each tier
