           - Count total responses/interviews, participant demographics
           - Note data collection method and date range
           - Identify any sampling biases
        2. Thematic Coding
           - Read through all responses systematically
           - Identify recurring themes and assign codes (e.g., "onboarding-friction", "pricing-confusion")
           - For each theme, tag frequency: how many participants mentioned it?
           - Extract verbatim quotes that best represent each theme (3-5 per theme)
        3. Sentiment Analysis
           - Classify each mention as positive, negative, neutral, or mixed
           - Identify the most emotionally charged topics
           - Note any surprising or contradictory sentiments
        4. Pattern Detection
           - Group related themes into higher-level categories
           - Identify correlations (e.g., users who complained about X also mentioned Y)
           - Note differences across user segments (power users vs new users, etc.)
        Output: coded dataset with theme frequencies, representative quotes, and segment breakdowns.

        Produce a benchmark comparison report:
        1. Benchmark Summary Dashboard
           - Table: metric, your value, industry median, top quartile, top decile
           - Color-code: green (above median), yellow (near median), red (below median)
        2. Performance Assessment per metric:
           - Where does the company stand relative to peers?
           - Is the gap closing or widening over time?
           - What would it take to reach the next quartile?
        3. Comparable Company Profiles
           - For each comp: key metrics, what they do well, lessons to learn
           - Identify the "north star" company to emulate
        4. Gap Analysis
           - Biggest gaps between current performance and industry leaders
           - Root cause hypotheses for underperformance
           - Estimated impact of closing each gap (revenue, cost, growth)
        5. Improvement Roadmap
           - Quick wins: metrics that can improve in 1-3 months
           - Medium-term: 3-6 month improvement initiatives
           - Strategic: 6-12 month structural changes needed
        6. Caveats and Methodology
           - Data limitations, sample sizes, and recency of benchmarks
           - Why direct comparisons may be imperfect (different markets, stages, models)
        Present data in comparison tables. Be specific about targets: "Improve NRR
        from 105% to 115% (median for your stage)" rather than vague advice.

      prompt: |
        Conduct a systematic literature search on the given topic:
        1. Search Strategy
           - Define the research question using PICO or similar framework
           - Develop search terms: primary keywords, synonyms, related terms
           - Search across multiple databases: Google Scholar, PubMed, arXiv, SSRN, Semantic Scholar
           - Apply date range filters (specify coverage period)
        2. Screening Process
           - Review titles and abstracts for relevance
           - Apply inclusion/exclusion criteria:
             * Must be peer-reviewed or from a credible institution
             * Must directly address the research question
             * Exclude opinion pieces without data (unless seminal)
           - Aim for 15-30 high-quality sources
        3. For each included source, extract:
           - Full citation (authors, year, title, journal/venue)
           - Study type (RCT, meta-analysis, case study, survey, theoretical, etc.)
           - Research question and methodology
           - Sample size and population
           - Key findings and conclusions
           - Limitations noted
           - Relevance score (1-5) to the research question
        4. Create a PRISMA-style flow: sources found → screened → included → final set
        Output: annotated bibliography with extraction data for each source.

        Write a comprehensive literature review from the annotated bibliography:
        1. Introduction
           - Research question and its significance
           - Scope and boundaries of the review
           - Overview of the field's development
        2. Methodology
           - Databases searched, search terms, date range
           - Inclusion/exclusion criteria
           - Number of sources screened vs included
        3. Thematic Analysis (organize findings by theme, NOT by source)
           - Identify 3-6 major themes across the literature
           - For each theme: what the evidence shows, areas of consensus, and debates
           - Highlight methodological trends (are studies getting more rigorous?)
           - Note how findings have evolved over time
        4. Critical Assessment
           - Overall quality of evidence (strong, moderate, weak)
           - Common methodological limitations across studies
           - Publication bias considerations
           - Geographic or demographic gaps in research
        5. Synthesis and Conceptual Framework
           - What do we know for certain? (convergent findings)
           - What remains contested? (divergent findings)
           - What is completely unknown? (research gaps)
           - Propose a conceptual framework or model that integrates key findings
        6. Future Research Directions
           - Specific research questions that need answering
           - Methodological improvements needed
           - Emerging areas worth exploring
        7. References — complete bibliography, formatted consistently
        Use hedging language appropriately ("evidence suggests" vs "proves").
        Never overstate the strength of individual studies. Synthesize across
        sources rather than summarizing each one sequentially.
